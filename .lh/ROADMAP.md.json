It provides lightweight access to Gemini, giving you the most direct path from your prompt to our model.\n\nThis document outlines our approach to the Gemini CLI roadmap. Here, you'll find our guiding principles and a breakdown of the key areas we are\nfocused on for development. Our roadmap is not a static list but a dynamic set of priorities that are tracked live in our GitHub Issues.\n\nAs an [Apache 2.0 open source project](https://github.com/aigo666/gemini-cli-new?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme), we appreciate and welcome [public contributions](https://github.com/aigo666/gemini-cli-new/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and will give first priority to those contributions aligned with our roadmap. If you want to propose a new feature or change to our roadmap, please start by [opening an issue for discussion](https://github.com/aigo666/gemini-cli-new/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis roadmap represents our current thinking and is for informational purposes only. It is not a commitment or a guarantee of future delivery. The development, release, and timing of any features are subject to change, and we may update the roadmap based on community discussions as well as when our priorities evolve.\n\n## Guiding Principles\n\nOur development is guided by the following principles:\n\n- **Power & Simplicity:** Deliver access to state-of-the-art Gemini models with an intuitive and easy-to-use lightweight command-line interface.\n- **Extensibility:** An adaptable agent to help you with a variety of use cases and environments along with the ability to run these agents anywhere.\n- **Intelligent:** Gemini CLI should be reliably ranked among the best agentic tools as measured by benchmarks like SWE Bench, Terminal Bench, and CSAT.\n- **Free and Open Source:** Foster a thriving open source community where cost isn’t a barrier to personal use, and PRs get merged quickly. This means resolving and closing issues, pull requests, and discussion posts quickly.\n\n## How the Roadmap Works\n\nOur roadmap is managed directly through Github Issues. See our entry point Roadmap Issue [here](https://github.com/a37836323/gemini-cli/issues/4191). This approach allows for transparency and gives you a direct way to learn more or get involved with any specific initiative. All our roadmap items will be tagged as Type:`Feature` and Label:`maintainer` for features we are actively working on, or Type:`Task` and Label:`maintainer` for a more detailed list of tasks.\n\nIssues are organized to provide key information at a glance:\n\n- **Target Quarter:** `Milestone` denotes the anticipated delivery timeline.\n- **Feature Area:** Labels such as `area/model` or `area/tooling` categorizes the work.\n- **Issue Type:** _Workstream_ => _Epics_ => _Features_ => _Tasks|Bugs_\n\nTo see what we're working on, you can filter our issues by these dimensions. See all our items [here](https://github.com/orgs/google-gemini/projects/11/views/19)\n\n## Focus Areas\n\nTo better organize our efforts, we categorize our work into several key feature areas. These labels are used on our GitHub Issues to help you filter and\nfind initiatives that interest you.\n\n- **Authentication:** Secure user access via API keys, Gemini Code Assist login etc.\n- **Model:** Support new Gemini models, multi-modality, local execution, and performance tuning.\n- **User Experience:** Improve the CLI's usability, performance, interactive features, and documentation.\n- **Tooling:** Built-in tools and the MCP ecosystem.\n- **Core:** Core functionality of the CLI\n- **Extensibility:** Bringing Gemini CLI to other surfaces e.g. GitHub.\n- **Contribution:** Improve the contribution process via test automation and CI/CD pipeline enhancements.\n- **Platform:** Manage installation, OS support, and the underlying CLI framework.\n- **Quality:** Focus on testing, reliability, performance, and overall product quality.\n- **Background Agents:** Enable long-running, autonomous tasks and proactive assistance.\n- **Security and Privacy:** For all things related to security and privacy\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nGemini CLI is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community!
