We\nuse [GitHub pull requests](https://docs.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests)\nfor this purpose.\n\n### Pull Request Guidelines\n\nTo help us review and merge your PRs quickly, please follow these guidelines. PRs that do not meet these standards may be closed.\n\n#### 1. Link to an Existing Issue\n\nAll PRs should be linked to an existing issue in our tracker. This ensures that every change has been discussed and is aligned with the project's goals before any code is written.\n\n- **For bug fixes:** The PR should be linked to the bug report issue.\n- **For features:** The PR should be linked to the feature request or proposal issue that has been approved by a maintainer.\n\nIf an issue for your change doesn't exist, please **open one first** and wait for feedback before you start coding.\n\n#### 2. Keep It Small and Focused\n\nWe favor small, atomic PRs that address a single issue or add a single, self-contained feature.\n\n- **Do:** Create a PR that fixes one specific bug or adds one specific feature.\n- **Don't:** Bundle multiple unrelated changes (e.g., a bug fix, a new feature, and a refactor) into a single PR.\n\nLarge changes should be broken down into a series of smaller, logical PRs that can be reviewed and merged independently.\n\n#### 3. Use Draft PRs for Work in Progress\n\nIf you'd like to get early feedback on your work, please use GitHub's **Draft Pull Request** feature. This signals to the maintainers that the PR is not yet ready for a formal review but is open for discussion and initial feedback.\n\n#### 4. Ensure All Checks Pass\n\nBefore submitting your PR, ensure that all automated checks are passing by running `npm run preflight`. This command runs all tests, linting, and other style checks.\n\n#### 5. Update Documentation\n\nIf your PR introduces a user-facing change (e.g., a new command, a modified flag, or a change in behavior), you must also update the relevant documentation in the `/docs` directory.\n\n#### 6. Write Clear Commit Messages and a Good PR Description\n\nYour PR should have a clear, descriptive title and a detailed description of the changes. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard for your commit messages.\n\n- **Good PR Title:** `feat(cli): Add --json flag to 'config get' command`\n- **Bad PR Title:** `Made some changes`\n\nIn the PR description, explain the \"why\" behind your changes and link to the relevant issue (e.g., `Fixes #123`).\n\n## Forking\n\nIf you are forking the repository you will be able to run the Build, Test and Integration test workflows. However in order to make the integration tests run you'll need to add a [GitHub Repository Secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository) with a value of `GEMINI_API_KEY` and set that to a valid API key that you have available. Your key and secret are private to your repo; no one without access can see your key and you cannot see any secrets related to this repo.\n\nAdditionally you will need to click on the `Actions` tab and enable workflows for your repository, you'll find it's the large blue button in the center of the screen.\n\n## Development Setup and Workflow\n\nThis section guides contributors on how to build, modify, and understand the development setup of this project.\n\n### Setting Up the Development Environment\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n1.  **Node.js**:\n    - **Development:** Please use Node.js `~20.19.0`. This specific version is required due to an upstream development dependency issue. You can use a tool like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.\n    - **Production:** For running the CLI in a production environment, any version of Node.js `>=20` is acceptable.\n2.  **Git**\n\n### Build Process\n\nTo clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/aigo666/gemini-cli-new.git # Or your fork's URL\ncd gemini-cli\n```\n\nTo install dependencies defined in `package.json` as well as root dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nTo build the entire project (all packages):\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis command typically compiles TypeScript to JavaScript, bundles assets, and prepares the packages for execution. Refer to `scripts/build.js` and `package.json` scripts for more details on what happens during the build.\n\n### Enabling Sandboxing\n\n[Sandboxing](#sandboxing) is highly recommended and requires, at a minimum, setting `GEMINI_SANDBOX=true` in your `~/.env` and ensuring a sandboxing provider (e.g. `macOS Seatbelt`, `docker`, or `podman`) is available. See [Sandboxing](#sandboxing) for details.\n\nTo build both the `gemini` CLI utility and the sandbox container, run `build:all` from the root directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build:all\n```\n\nTo skip building the sandbox container, you can use `npm run build` instead.\n\n### Running\n\nTo start the Gemini CLI from the source code (after building), run the following command from the root directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm start\n```\n\nIf you'd like to run the source build outside of the gemini-cli folder you can utilize `npm link path/to/gemini-cli/packages/cli` (see: [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-link)) or `alias gemini=\"node path/to/gemini-cli/packages/cli\"` to run with `gemini`\n\n### Running Tests\n\nThis project contains two types of tests: unit tests and integration tests.\n\n#### Unit Tests\n\nTo execute the unit test suite for the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test\n```\n\nThis will run tests located in the `packages/core` and `packages/cli` directories. Ensure tests pass before submitting any changes. For a more comprehensive check, it is recommended to run `npm run preflight`.\n\n#### Integration Tests\n\nThe integration tests are designed to validate the end-to-end functionality of the Gemini CLI. They are not run as part of the default `npm run test` command.\n\nTo run the integration tests, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run test:e2e\n```\n\nFor more detailed information on the integration testing framework, please see the [Integration Tests documentation](./docs/integration-tests.md).\n\n### Linting and Preflight Checks\n\nTo ensure code quality and formatting consistency, run the preflight check:\n\n```bash\nnpm run preflight\n```\n\nThis command will run ESLint, Prettier, all tests, and other checks as defined in the project's `package.json`.\n\n_ProTip_\n\nafter cloning create a git precommit hook file to ensure your commits are always clean.\n\n```bash\necho \"\n# Run npm build and check for errors\nif ! npm run preflight; then\n  echo \"npm build failed. Commit aborted.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\" > .git/hooks/pre-commit && chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\n#### Formatting\n\nTo separately format the code in this project by running the following command from the root directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm run format\n```\n\nThis command uses Prettier to format the code according to the project's style guidelines.\n\n#### Linting\n\nTo separately lint the code in this project, run the following command from the root directory:\n\n```bash\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n### Coding Conventions\n\n- Please adhere to the coding style, patterns, and conventions used throughout the existing codebase.\n- Consult [GEMINI.md](https://github.com/a37836323/gemini-cli/blob/main/GEMINI.md) (typically found in the project root) for specific instructions related to AI-assisted development, including conventions for React, comments, and Git usage.\n- **Imports:** Pay special attention to import paths. The project uses ESLint to enforce restrictions on relative imports between packages.\n\n### Project Structure\n\n- `packages/`: Contains the individual sub-packages of the project.\n  - `cli/`: The command-line interface.\n  - `core/`: The core backend logic for the Gemini CLI.\n- `docs/`: Contains all project documentation.\n- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building, testing, and development tasks.\n\nFor more detailed architecture, see `docs/architecture.md`.\n\n## Debugging\n\n### VS Code:\n\n0.  Run the CLI to interactively debug in VS Code with `F5`\n1.  Start the CLI in debug mode from the root directory:\n    ```bash\n    npm run debug\n    ```\n    This command runs `node --inspect-brk dist/gemini.js` within the `packages/cli` directory, pausing execution until a debugger attaches. You can then open `chrome://inspect` in your Chrome browser to connect to the debugger.\n2.  In VS Code, use the \"Attach\" launch configuration (found in `.vscode/launch.json`).\n\nAlternatively, you can use the \"Launch Program\" configuration in VS Code if you prefer to launch the currently open file directly, but 'F5' is generally recommended.\n\nTo hit a breakpoint inside the sandbox container run:\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=1 gemini\n```\n\n### React DevTools\n\nTo debug the CLI's React-based UI, you can use React DevTools. Ink, the library used for the CLI's interface, is compatible with React DevTools version 4.x.\n\n1.  **Start the Gemini CLI in development mode:**\n\n    ```bash\n    DEV=true npm start\n    ```\n\n2.  **Install and run React DevTools version 4.28.5 (or the latest compatible 4.x version):**\n\n    You can either install it globally:\n\n    ```bash\n    npm install -g react-devtools@4.28.5\n    react-devtools\n    ```\n\n    Or run it directly using npx:\n\n    ```bash\n    npx react-devtools@4.28.5\n    ```\n\n    Your running CLI application should then connect to React DevTools.\n    ![](/docs/assets/connected_devtools.png)\n\n## Sandboxing\n\n### macOS Seatbelt\n\nOn macOS, `gemini` uses Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) under a `permissive-open` profile (see `packages/cli/src/utils/sandbox-macos-permissive-open.sb`) that restricts writes to the project folder but otherwise allows all other operations and outbound network traffic (\"open\") by default. You can switch to a `restrictive-closed` profile (see `packages/cli/src/utils/sandbox-macos-restrictive-closed.sb`) that declines all operations and outbound network traffic (\"closed\") by default by setting `SEATBELT_PROFILE=restrictive-closed` in your environment or `.env` file. Available built-in profiles are `{permissive,restrictive}-{open,closed,proxied}` (see below for proxied networking). You can also switch to a custom profile `SEATBELT_PROFILE=<profile>` if you also create a file `.gemini/sandbox-macos-<profile>.sb` under your project settings directory `.gemini`.\n\n### Container-based Sandboxing (All Platforms)\n\nFor stronger container-based sandboxing on macOS or other platforms, you can set `GEMINI_SANDBOX=true|docker|podman|<command>` in your environment or `.env` file. The specified command (or if `true` then either `docker` or `podman`) must be installed on the host machine. Once enabled, `npm run build:all` will build a minimal container (\"sandbox\") image and `npm start` will launch inside a fresh instance of that container. The first build can take 20-30s (mostly due to downloading of the base image) but after that both build and start overhead should be minimal. Default builds (`npm run build`) will not rebuild the sandbox.\n\nContainer-based sandboxing mounts the project directory (and system temp directory) with read-write access and is started/stopped/removed automatically as you start/stop Gemini CLI. Files created within the sandbox should be automatically mapped to your user/group on host machine. You can easily specify additional mounts, ports, or environment variables by setting `SANDBOX_{MOUNTS,PORTS,ENV}` as needed. You can also fully customize the sandbox for your projects by creating the files `.gemini/sandbox.Dockerfile` and/or `.gemini/sandbox.bashrc` under your project settings directory (`.gemini`) and running `gemini` with `BUILD_SANDBOX=1` to trigger building of your custom sandbox.\n\n#### Proxied Networking\n\nAll sandboxing methods, including macOS Seatbelt using `*-proxied` profiles, support restricting outbound network traffic through a custom proxy server that can be specified as `GEMINI_SANDBOX_PROXY_COMMAND=<command>`, where `<command>` must start a proxy server that listens on `:::8877` for relevant requests. See `docs/examples/proxy-script.md` for a minimal proxy that only allows `HTTPS` connections to `example.com:443` (e.g. `curl https://example.com`) and declines all other requests. The proxy is started and stopped automatically alongside the sandbox.\n\n## Manual Publish\n\nWe publish an artifact for each commit to our internal registry. But if you need to manually cut a local build, then run the following commands:\n\n```\nnpm run clean\nnpm install\nnpm run auth\nnpm run prerelease:dev\nnpm publish --workspaces\n```\n"
